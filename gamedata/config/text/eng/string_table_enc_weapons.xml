In 1984 RAI signed a contract for serial production of these rounds with Lapua (Finland), and new ammunition began its way to popularity. .338 Lapua Magnum provides high accuracy (up to 1500 meters) due to excellent ballistics and powerful charge. It's widely used with sniper rifles and with hunting rifles for hunting on big wildfowl. Sniper rifles with these rounds are widely used in many armed forces around the world.</text>

Relatively small recoil combined with specially designed high quality subsonic ammunition with an effective range of 400 meters contribute heavily to its accuracy. The heavy bullet makes almost zero noise due to absence of supersonic shock waves, its weight also helps it stabilize during flight, which has a positive impact on flatness of trajectory.</text>

A relatively rare find in the Zone due to limited production. The general idea was to create a shortened version of the SVD sniper rifle with as little negative impact on the accuracy as possible, so the designers went with a bullpup design. The barrel has been shortened and comes with a pre-attached sound suppressor which also acts as a muzzle brake. The plastic pistol grip is located near the middle of the gun and has a comfortable shape. The SVU-A allows for automatic fire, but it should be noted that it should be used only in the most extreme cases of emergency, as both the barrel and the small magazine weren't intended for this kind of abuse.</text>

The accuracy of this gun combined with the stopping power and velocity of the cartridge exceed those of all other small arms as the bullet's high kinetic energy renders virtually every bulletproof vest useless.

	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-flame">
		<text>A makeshift flamethrower constructed by a freedomer called Screw. Its main and obvious purpose is to set things on fire, mostly organic lifeforms. The flamethrower's design is fairly simple - it projects a stream of flammable liquid which is then ignited spontaneously in air. Due to the high reactivity of the flammable mixture, some parts of the flamethrower have been made from high-quality corrosion-resistant materials produced in special laboratory conditions. How did Screw manage to gain access to such materials is known by no one else but him. Due to rarity of high-quality materials in the Zone, Screw's flamethrower was unable to be mass-produced, which is a big shame.</text>

In comparison with the Makarov, the APS curb-stomps it in almost every aspect - superior firepower, high rate of fire, bigger magazine and a longer barrel.</text>
